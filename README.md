# 01f-lemin
Projects I worked on while learning at 01founders, project description at: https://github.com/01-edu/public/tree/master/subjects/lem-in

While working on this project we hadn't yet come across the relevant ideal algorithms (A modified version of edmonds-karp/ ford-fulkerson) and in hindsight we should have used those to implement this. As is a lot of it was based on trial and error while becoming familiar with implementing and traversing graphs.
